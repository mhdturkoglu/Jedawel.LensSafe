# Summary: Eye Rubbing Detection Accuracy Improvements

## Problem
After recent improvements to reduce false positives, the system became too conservative and started having false negatives - sometimes even when the user rubbed their eye, the system would not give a warning.

## Root Cause
The previous update added depth and motion detection to prevent false positives when hands were near the face. However, the thresholds were set too strictly:
- `depth_threshold`: 0.05 was too strict for natural depth variation during rubbing
- `motion_threshold`: 0.01 was too high for gentle/slow rubbing motions
- `consecutive_frames_threshold`: 3 was too conservative when combined with strict motion/depth checks

## Solution Implemented

### Threshold Adjustments
| Parameter | Old | New | Change | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| `depth_threshold` | 0.05 | 0.08 | +60% | Allow natural depth variation |
| `motion_threshold` | 0.01 | 0.004 | -60% | Detect slower rubbing |
| `consecutive_frames_threshold` | 3 | 2 | -33% | Faster response |

### Files Modified
1. **config.json** - Updated default thresholds
2. **baby_monitor.py** - Updated default config in code
3. **README.md** - Updated documentation with new defaults
4. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Updated technical documentation
5. **test_threshold_adjustments.py** - New comprehensive test suite (209 lines)
6. **THRESHOLD_ADJUSTMENTS.md** - Detailed explanation document (124 lines)

### Testing
- ✅ All 33 tests pass (12 motion + 13 depth + 8 new threshold tests)
- ✅ New test suite validates all threshold adjustments
- ✅ CodeQL security scan: 0 vulnerabilities found

### Benefits
- ✅ **Detects gentle/slow rubbing** - Reduced motion threshold catches slower motions
- ✅ **Handles depth variation** - Increased depth threshold accommodates natural hand movement
- ✅ **Faster response** - Reduced consecutive frames for quicker detection
- ✅ **Maintains false positive prevention** - Motion and depth checks still prevent static hand alerts
- ✅ **Better balance** - System now handles full range of rubbing motions from gentle to vigorous

## What Changed in Behavior

### Now Detects (Fixed False Negatives)
- Gentle/slow eye rubbing motions
- Rubbing with slight hand depth variation
- Brief rubbing events (2+ frames instead of 3+)
- Natural rubbing patterns with varying motion speed

### Still Prevents (Maintains False Positive Prevention)
- Hand resting on face without motion
- Hand waving far in front of face  
- Very minimal hand movements
- Single-frame detection errors

## Configuration Flexibility
Users can still fine-tune thresholds in `config.json` based on their specific needs:

**For fewer false negatives (more sensitive):**
```json
{
  "depth_threshold": 0.10,
  "motion_threshold": 0.003,
  "consecutive_frames_threshold": 1
}
```

**For fewer false positives (more conservative):**
```json
{
  "depth_threshold": 0.06,
  "motion_threshold": 0.006,
  "consecutive_frames_threshold": 3
}
```

## Technical Details

### Motion Threshold Calculation
- Old: 0.01 × 640px ≈ 6.4 pixels per frame
- New: 0.004 × 640px ≈ 2.56 pixels per frame
- This allows detection of gentler rubbing motions

### Depth Threshold
- MediaPipe provides normalized depth (Z-coordinate)
- Increased from 0.05 to 0.08 allows for natural depth variation
- Still prevents detection when hand is far from eye depth

### Consecutive Frames
- Reduced from 3 to 2 frames
- Provides faster response while filtering single-frame errors
- Combined with motion check ensures sustained rubbing detection

## Validation

### Test Coverage
- **Motion Detection Tests**: 12 tests validating motion tracking
- **Depth Detection Tests**: 13 tests validating depth checks
- **Threshold Adjustment Tests**: 8 new tests validating changes

### Test Scenarios Covered
1. Gentle rubbing detection
2. Slight depth variation handling
3. Faster detection response
4. Static hand rejection (false positive prevention)
5. Excessive depth difference rejection
6. Realistic eye rubbing scenarios
7. Configuration value verification

## Security
- CodeQL scan: **0 vulnerabilities**
- No security issues introduced
- All changes are configuration/threshold adjustments
- No changes to core security-sensitive logic

## Documentation
- Updated README.md with new defaults and troubleshooting
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with technical details
- Created THRESHOLD_ADJUSTMENTS.md with comprehensive explanation
- All documentation reflects new threshold values

## Commits
1. `dc2416f` - Adjust detection thresholds to reduce false negatives
2. `d2c476d` - Further reduce motion threshold to 0.004 for better sensitivity
3. `53f2eeb` - Add comprehensive documentation for threshold adjustments
4. `7bdf450` - Address code review feedback on documentation

## Result
The eye rubbing detection system now provides better accuracy with:
- Improved detection of actual eye rubbing (reduced false negatives)
- Maintained prevention of false alarms (kept false positive protection)
- Faster response time
- Better handling of natural rubbing variations
- Comprehensive testing and documentation

**Status**: ✅ Ready for review and merge
